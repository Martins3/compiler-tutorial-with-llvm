You are supposed to implement a flow-sensitive, field- and context-insensitive algorithm to compute the 
points-to set for each variable at each distinct program point.
One approach is to extend the provided dataflow analysis framework as follows: 
- Implement your representation of points-to sets
- Implement the transfer function for each instruction
- Implement the MEET operator
- Extend the control flow graph to be inter-procedural
